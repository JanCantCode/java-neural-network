# java-neural-network
A simple neural network in java

This project is mainly me trying around with neural networks and how to implement them in order to understand them better. 
The Project provides multiple "subprojects" = main classes, that. i run stuff in.


Currently just basic neural networks are supported but i will eventually add RNN CNN and transformers etc. (if you are smart feel free to make issues and correct mistakes in my code or shit haha)
